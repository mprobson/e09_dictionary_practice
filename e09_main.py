    # 2. Asks the user for a number of points
    # 3. Adds the points value to a dictionary using the name as key
    # 4. Prints the contents of the dictionary (using the normal print)
    # 5. Asks the user if they want to add more inputs
    #    If Yesâ€¦ go to 1 (go to next iteration),
    #    Else exit the loop

  # AFTER the loop, prints the whole dictionary
